# create-react-app

React app boilerplate

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@creuna/create-react-app.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@creuna/create-react-app)

## Usage

#### Install

```
npm install -g @creuna/cli
```

#### Create new app

**Requires node >= 7.5.x**

```
creuna new
```

This will install files to the **current working directory**, so make sure you `cd` to where you want to install. Alternatively, you can provide a path like this (relative to the current working directory):

```
creuna new projects/my-project
```

## Options

### üöÄ Project name

This will be used in `package.json` as well as for `<title>` in the mockup and `<h1>` on the mockup frontpage.

---

### üò∏ Your full name

Used in the `author` field in `package.json`

---

### üíå Your email address

Used in the `author` field in `package.json`

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Include API-helper?

If you select this, `source/js/api-helper.js` will be included. This is a handy abstraction of `fetch` that supports automating analytics (optional), showing status messages (optional) and working with mock API responses.

#### Usage:

```js
api.execute(url, data).then(response => {
  // do something with response
}
```

---

### üí¨ Include message helper for API?

If you select this, `source/js/messenger.js` and `source/components/message` will be included. Also, the messenger helper is automagically wired up with the API-helper.

#### Usage:

For the messenger helper to work, API responses have to be formatted as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "messageToUser": "Your request succeeded!",
  "payload": {
    //actual content of API response
  }
}
```

If an API response includes a `messageToUser`, it will tell the `Message` component to show it. The `success` property tells the `Message` component whether to display the message as an error or as a confirmation. The `Message` component needs to be rendered somewhere in order to work.

When a `payload` object is present in the response, only the content of `payload` will be returned from `api.execute`.

---

### üìà Include Analytics helper?

If you select this, `source/js/analytics.js` will be included and wired up to work with the API-helper.

#### Usage:

```js
const analyticsData = {}; // some google analytics data

analytics.send(analyticsData);
```

This will push `analyticsData` to `window.dataLayer`. `send` supports both objects and arrays.

#### With API-helper

If you format your API response in the following way (or make another human do so), `analytics` will be pushed to `window.dataLayer` automatically.

```
{
  "analytics": {
    // some analytics data here
  },
  "payload": {
    //actual content of API response
  }
}
```

When a `payload` object is present in the response, only the content of `payload` will be returned from `api.execute`.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Include responsive images helper?

If you select this the following files will be included:

* `source/js/responsive-images.js`
* `source/components/image`
* `source/components/fluid-image`

These are intended to be used with the [ImageResizer for .NET](https://imageresizing.net/) plugin. The `Image` and `FluidImage` components use `responsive-images.js` to measure the rendered images and get the URL for an image of appropriate size.

---

## Project structure

#### React components

Put React components in `source/components`. It is recommended to have each component in a separate folder, containing a `jsx` file, a `scss` file and an `index.js` file.

If the folder and the `jsx` file have the same name, the component will be included in the generated `app.components.js` file which can be used to render components on a backend (like React.NET).

#### Assets

Put your assets like fonts, icons and logos in `source/assets`. Mockup content assets can be put in `source/mockup/assets`. Webpack copies everything from `source/mockup/assets` to `/mockup/assets`, so you can refer to your mockup files like this:

```json
{
  "imageUrl": "/mockup/assets/my-image.jpg"
}
```

#### Mockup

Before Webpack dev server runs, the frontpage of the mockup will be generated. All mockup pages that have a folder and a component of the same name as well as an `index.js` file will get a link on the frontpage. You can customize the name and group name in the `jsx` file by adding a comment to the first line like this:

```js
// Group name/Page name
```

Pages with the same group name will be grouped on the frontpage.

#### Mocking API responses

Webpack will copy everything from `source/mockup/api` to `/mockup/api` you can reference your mock API responses like this:

```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "/mockup/api/register-user.json"
}
```

## Aliases

By default, two aliases are included in `webpack.config`:

* `components` which resolves to `source/components`
* `js` which resolves to `source/js`

These aliases allow you to import like this from any `js`/`jsx` file:

```
import SomeComponent from 'components/some-component';
import someScript from 'js/some-script';
```

These aliases are also included in `jsconfig.json` which makes VS Code resolve the aliases, giving you autocomplete.

## Input detection

`js/input-detection.js` is included in both the `client` and `static` bundles. It checks for mouse, touch and keyboard events and puts classnames on `<html>`:

* `.mouse-user`: The last event was either a mouse or touch event (this is removed when a keyboard event occurs)
* `.touchevents`: The last event was a touch event
* `.no-touchevents`: The last event was not a touch event

By default, all focus outlines are disabled when the `.mouse-user` class is present (in `site.scss`). No class names are present if js is disabled in the browser, meaning focus outlines are preserved.

You can use these classnames to provide alternative styling based on input method (like disabling hover effects for touch screens).

## UI Testing

[Chimp](https://chimp.readme.io/docs/introduction) is included for easy end to end testing. The provided config `./chimpconfig.js` uses Mocha and headless (invisible) Chrome to perform tests on the ui. There is an example test provided in `/tests/example-page.js`

### Things to note

* run tests with `yarn test:ui` or `npm run test:ui`.
* **Webpack dev server needs to be running for tests to work.**
* With the provided config, Chimp uses Mocha and WebdriverIO.
  * Mocha provides the `describe` and `it` globals. [docs here](https://mochajs.org/)
  * WebdriverIO provides the `browser` global. [docs here](http://webdriver.io/api.html)
* Use Chai for test assertions. [docs here](http://www.chaijs.com/api/)
* Put tests in `./tests` (or provide an alternative path in `chimpconfig.js`
* Test files can be named anything, and subfolders are supported.

## Scripts

Included is a couple of utility scripts for lazy people. You can use these from the terminal or from within VS Code if you use that.

### Create new component

`yarn component component-name`

This creates the folder `source/components/component-name` and puts `component-name.jsx`, `component-name.scss` and `index.js` inside it. Sweeeeeet! üòÑ You do need to restart webpack dev server in order for the `scss` file to be noticed by webpack.

---

### Create new mockup page

`yarn mockup page-name`

Works much like the above script, but does not create a `.scss` file and creates a `.json` file for mockup data instead. You need to restart webpack dev server in order for the new page to show up on the front page of the mockup.

---

### Rename component

`yarn rename old-name new-name`. This will rename:

* the `old-name` folder
* `old-name.jsx`
* `old-name.scss`
* The component name in `old-name.jsx` and `index.js`
* all css class names in `old-name.jsx` and `old-name.scss`

If you have sub-components in the same folder, these need to be renamed manually.

---

### Convert component to stateless

`yarn to-stateless component-name`

This will convert `source/components/component-name` to a stateless component if it can. These things need to happen before you can convert:

* Remove all lifecycle methods
* Remove all references to `this.state`
* Remove all refs

You can usually tell if a component can be converted to stateless by the eslint warning saying that it should be converted to stateless.

---

### Convert component to stateful

`yarn to-stateful component-name`

This will convert `source/components/component-name` to a stateful component.

## VS Code tasks

If you're using VS Code, you can run the above scripts from within the editor. Running tasks this way is nice because `rename`, `to-stateful` and `to-stateless` will not require any typing if you already have the file you want to convert/rename open in your editor.

Open the Command Pallette (`View -> Command Pallette`) or `‚áß‚åòP`, type `run task` and select `Tasks: Run Task`. Then, start typing the name of the script you want to run, like `rename` or `component` and press return when you see the right one. This will open a terminal window inside Code, which can be closed by pressing any key once the script has finished.

If you want to run the scripts from within Code, it's a good idea to map the `Run Task` command to a keyboard shortcut, to avoid excessive typing.
