# create-react-app

React app boilerplate

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@creuna/create-react-app.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@creuna/create-react-app)

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage

We recommend running this from [@creuna/cli](https://github.com/Creuna-Oslo/cli).

If you want to create a new app from JavaScript, this is the right module for you.

### Dependencies

The React app relies on `node-gyp` which means you might have to install some things to get it running. Please see [node-gyp docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for instructions for your OS if you run into trouble.

**Requires node >= 7.5.x**

## Options

### üöÄ Project name

This will be used in `package.json` as well as for `<title>` in the mockup and `<h1>` on the mockup frontpage.

---

### üò∏ Your full name

Used in the `author` field in `package.json`

---

### üíå Your email address

Used in the `author` field in `package.json`

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Include API-helper?

If you select this, `source/js/api-helper.js` will be included. This is a handy abstraction of `fetch` that supports automating analytics (optional), showing status messages (optional) and working with mock API responses.

#### Usage:

```js
api.execute(url, data).then(response => {
  // do something with response
}
```

---

### üí¨ Include message helper for API?

If you select this, `source/js/messenger.js` and `source/components/message` will be included. Also, the messenger helper is automagically wired up with the API-helper.

#### Usage:

For the messenger helper to work, API responses have to be formatted as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "messageToUser": "Your request succeeded!",
  "payload": {
    //actual content of API response
  }
}
```

If an API response includes a `messageToUser`, it will tell the `Message` component to show it. The `success` property tells the `Message` component whether to display the message as an error or as a confirmation. The `Message` component needs to be rendered somewhere in order to work.

When a `payload` object is present in the response, only the content of `payload` will be returned from `api.execute`.

---

### üìà Include Analytics helper?

If you select this, `source/js/analytics.js` will be included and wired up to work with the API-helper.

#### Usage:

```js
const analyticsData = {}; // some google analytics data

analytics.send(analyticsData);
```

This will push `analyticsData` to `window.dataLayer`. `send` supports both objects and arrays.

#### With API-helper

If you format your API response in the following way (or make another human do so), `analytics` will be pushed to `window.dataLayer` automatically.

```
{
  "analytics": {
    // some analytics data here
  },
  "payload": {
    //actual content of API response
  }
}
```

When a `payload` object is present in the response, only the content of `payload` will be returned from `api.execute`.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Include responsive images helper?

If you select this the following files will be included:

* `source/js/responsive-images.js`
* `source/components/image`
* `source/components/fluid-image`

These are intended to be used with the [ImageResizer for .NET](https://imageresizing.net/) plugin. The `Image` and `FluidImage` components use `responsive-images.js` to measure the rendered images and get the URL for an image of appropriate size.

---

## Project structure

#### React components

Put React components in `source/components`. It is recommended to have each component in a separate folder, containing a `jsx` file, a `scss` file and an `index.js` file.

If the folder and the `jsx` file have the same name, the component will be included in the generated `app.components.js` file which can be used to render components on a backend (like React.NET).

#### Assets

Put your assets like fonts, icons and logos in `source/assets`. Mockup content assets can be put in `source/mockup/assets`. Webpack copies everything from `source/mockup/assets` to `/mockup/assets`, so you can refer to your mockup files like this:

```json
{
  "imageUrl": "/mockup/assets/my-image.jpg"
}
```

#### Mockup

Before Webpack dev server runs, the frontpage of the mockup will be generated. All mockup pages that have a folder and a component of the same name as well as an `index.js` file will get a link on the frontpage. You can customize the name and group name in the `jsx` file by adding a comment to the first line like this:

```js
// Group name/Page name
```

Pages with the same group name will be grouped on the frontpage.

#### Mocking API responses

Webpack will copy everything from `source/mockup/api` to `/mockup/api` you can reference your mock API responses like this:

```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "/mockup/api/register-user.json"
}
```

## Aliases

By default, two aliases are included in `webpack.config`:

* `components` which resolves to `source/components`
* `js` which resolves to `source/js`

These aliases allow you to import like this from any `js`/`jsx` file:

```
import SomeComponent from 'components/some-component';
import someScript from 'js/some-script';
```

These aliases are also included in `jsconfig.json` which makes VS Code resolve the aliases, giving you autocomplete.

## Input detection

`js/input-detection.js` is included in both the `client` and `static` bundles. It checks for mouse, touch and keyboard events and puts classnames on `<html>`:

* `.mouse-user`: The last event was either a mouse or touch event (this is removed when a keyboard event occurs)
* `.touchevents`: The last event was a touch event
* `.no-touchevents`: The last event was not a touch event

By default, all focus outlines are disabled when the `.mouse-user` class is present (in `site.scss`). No class names are present if js is disabled in the browser, meaning focus outlines are preserved.

You can use these classnames to provide alternative styling based on input method (like disabling hover effects for touch screens).

## UI Testing

[Chimp](https://chimp.readme.io/docs/introduction) is included for easy end to end testing. The provided config `./chimpconfig.js` uses Mocha and headless (invisible) Chrome to perform tests on the ui. There is an example test provided in `/tests/example-page.js`

### Things to note

* run tests with `yarn test:ui` or `npm run test:ui`.
* **Webpack dev server needs to be running for tests to work.**
* With the provided config, Chimp uses Mocha and WebdriverIO.
  * Mocha provides the `describe` and `it` globals. [docs here](https://mochajs.org/)
  * WebdriverIO provides the `browser` global. [docs here](http://webdriver.io/api.html)
* Use Chai for test assertions. [docs here](http://www.chaijs.com/api/)
* Put tests in `./tests` (or provide an alternative path in `chimpconfig.js`
* Test files can be named anything, and subfolders are supported.

## VS Code tasks

`./.vscode/tasks.json` is included which enables you to run scripts from [@creuna/react-scripts](https://github.com/Creuna-Oslo/react-scripts) if you're using VS Code.
Running tasks this way is nice because the currently open file in Code is used as input for some of the scripts which means you can type less.

Open the Command Pallette (`View -> Command Pallette`) or `‚áß‚åòP`, type `run task` and select `Tasks: Run Task`. Then, start typing the name of the script you want to run, like `rename` or `component` and press Return when you see the right one. This will open a terminal window inside Code, which can be closed by pressing any key once the script has finished.

If you want to run the scripts from within Code, it's a good idea to map the `Run Task` command to a keyboard shortcut, to avoid excessive typing.
